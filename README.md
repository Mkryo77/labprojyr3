This repository is dedicated to showcasing the highlights from the laboratory project I completed for the 3rd year of my MPhys Physics and Astronomy Degree at Durham University. For this project I had to collect data using Durham's telescopes which required me to learn and be able to use Linux. Once I collected all of my data using the telescopes I had to analyse it all using a variety of different methods, most of which I had to write myself using a number of python libraries. The project was based around finding a period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables. These are stars whose brightness varies according to a timescale which is a function of their brightness and so by undertaking this analysis, I aimed to calculate the relationship between the time period and the brightness variation and then compare it to literature values.

These files were all saved on a computer in the lab as this is where all of the telescope data was stored so they were not arranged very well. I have separated them into text files (required for the python files), python files and images of graphs to make things easy.
